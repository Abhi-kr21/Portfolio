                    <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that is used for developing dynamic and interactive web pages.
                        It is a client-side language, meaning that it is executed on the user’s browser and not on the
                        web server. JavaScript is primarily used for enhancing the user experience by adding
                        interactivity, animations, and other dynamic elements to web pages</p>
